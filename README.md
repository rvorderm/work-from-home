# Work From Home (WFH) Essentials

This is a community-driven guide to enhance your Work From Home (WFH) setup with expert tips, recommended equipment, and resources. Perfect for improving productivity and comfort in remote work. Contributions welcome, and desired!

_WHY are we doing this?_ Because, as a great mentor once said to me: 

> If someone asks you a (work related) question, write down the answer. It'll save you time the next time someone answers.

> Thus, I humbly ask that if you have benefitted from this resource, please pay it forward to the next person by submitting a PR and improving this.

**Current State**
This is a V1 document, meant to be developed with some of my close network. For that reason the current version is only this readme, while the long term plan is more detailed and structured. Seperate files. Maybe some static site generation similar to how devhints.io works (but not in Ruby, maybe [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/))
